This project develops a system that provides career path recommendations based on a user's qualifications, skills, and interests. The system allows user to input their educational background, professional experience, and areas of interest. A rule-based matching engine will then compare this information with a database of job roles and required skills to generate personalized career suggestions. The expert system will include an intuitive user interface for input, and the recommendations will be supported by explanations regarding the suitability of the roles. The aim is to make career decisions by providing job recommendations.
